Just a test TWI Master library for the ATmega324PB based on a great tutorial and 
source code written by [Chris Herring](http://www.chrisherring.net/all/tutorial-interrupt-driven-twi-interface-for-avr-part1/).

If you're looking for a place to start with TWI, the tutorial mentioned above along with specific MCU datasheet are great places to start.

This library currently only implements TWI0 inteface in Master Transmit/Receive mode and the purpose of this library is purely educational for myself.
